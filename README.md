# PNG Decoder Written in Kotlin
A simple PNG decoder written in Kotlin. This started as a small stand alone project to learn about the PNG format and a chance for me to better understand Kotlin. I'm planning to make this a fully functional decoder that can be used in any project you like.

Currently, the library is able to read meta information of a PNG image and to detect if a PNG is valid. Also, the data bytes are correctly inflated and could be transformed into an image. 

## TODO
- [ ] Transforming the imagedata into an actual image
- [ ] Write tests using the Spek framework
- [ ] Comment the code
- [ ] Add a linter and travis to the repository.

WARNING: THIS IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS REPOSITORY
